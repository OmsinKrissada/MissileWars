- Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMCrEs1yW9w) for **introduction** to the game.
- Check out [CubeKrowd.net](https://cubekrowd.net/) for the **official Missile Wars server** and more info.

## Plugin Information

This plugin allows you to play MissileWars on your own server!\
Spigot/Paper is required. Paper is recommended since Spigot tends to skip redstone ticks, causing missiles to stop.

Supporting 1.13.X-1.20.X, ... I guess?

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Depends on [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit)! **DO NOT USE FAWE** or missiles will not move because of disabled block physics.

The plugin contains world data needed to play Missile Wars, no world download required.
